# Hello-world

Dumpster repository for unused code, small scripts and ideas.

This repository is my first Github repository. I use it for small,
completed or uncompleted scripts that don't fit in some other repository.

Every completed script has it's own README.md file. Any new idea, comment or
suggestions to the scripts in this repository are more then welcome. Most of
them are in languages I've never programmed in. All advise is
apperciated.

Thanks to all people that share my passion and are willing to collaberate. And
to all people who's work inspired me.
