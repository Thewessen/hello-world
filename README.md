# Hello-world
Testrepository with all unused code and great ideas

My name is Samuel Thewessen. I'm a teacher in mathematics and calculation skills. My goal on github is collaberatly making a website for supporting lessons in mathematics and calculation skills. The website must contain lots of exercises, vids and explanations.

Im new to coding. And this repository is my first repository at github. In this repository ill store all great idea's and things if learned during the road of creating a website. Some of these idea's are directly related of creating an exercise containing website. Others are just great fun.

Thanks to all people that share my passion and are willing to collaberate. And to all people who's work inspired me.
